/******************************************************************************
 Question 2: Ludo King 

Write a Java program to find the winner of a Ludo game based on points scored by three players.

The program should:

Read Alex’s points

Read Nikil’s points

Read Sam’s points

🔍 Validation rules:

If any player’s points are less than 0 or greater than 50, print

<points> is an invalid number


and terminate the program.

🏆 Winner rules:

If Alex has the highest points → print

Alex scored <points> points and won the game


If Nikil has the highest points → print

Nikil scored <points> points and won the game


Otherwise, Sam is the winner.
