                            Question 4: Oxygen Plants 

Write a Java program to calculate the number of plants that can be placed on a floor area and the amount of oxygen produced per day.

The program should:

Read the floor area of the room (length and breadth in meters)

Read the area occupied by a single plant (in cm²)

Calculate the total number of plants that can be placed on the floor
(ignore fractional plants)

Calculate the oxygen produced per day, assuming each plant produces 0.9 litres of oxygen

📤 Output format:

Display the result in the following format:

Total plants placed on floor area <length>*<breadth> is <number_of_plants> plants produces <oxygen> litres of oxygen in a day
